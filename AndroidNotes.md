# L2: Kotlin Level 1
1. Introduction
    1. Kotlin is recommended language by Google. 
    2. Kotlin is a modern language that boosts developer productivity.
    3. It lets you write less code for the same tasks.
    4. Kotlin apps are more stable and crash less.
    5. It's widely used by professional Android developers.
2. Info
    1. A program is a set of instructions for a computer or device to perform actions.
    2. Code is the step-by-step instructions written by the programmer.
    3. A code editor helps write and edit code with features like autocomplete and error detection.
    4. Kotlin Playground is a web-based code editor for practicing Kotlin.
    5. No software installation is needed to use Kotlin Playground.
    6. Kotlin Playground allows running and editing Kotlin code in the browser.
    7. Android apps cannot be built in Kotlin Playground.
    8. Android Studio will be used later for writing Android app code.
3. About Kotlin playground
    - **Explain the structure of playground** 
    1. Kotlin code is easy for humans to read but not directly understood by computers.
    2. The Kotlin compiler converts this code into machine instructions.
    3. If compilation succeeds, the program runs and follows each instruction.
4. Hello world  
    ```kotlin
    fun main() {
        println("kotlin")
    } 
    ```
    1. `main` is the starting point of a Kotlin program. Every Kotlin program must have a `main` function.
